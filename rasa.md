Rasa theory recogsnised as the prime achievement of Bharata

> "'Nothing proceeds on the stage without reference to rasa' is Bharata's most important
pronouncement" says Raghavan in his research paper entitled ―Sanskrit Drama in Performance‖ (21). The Sanskrit word rasa fundamentally means 'taste' or 'flavour' or 'savour' or 'relish'. In a metaphorical sense it refers to "the emotional experience of beauty in poetry and drama" (Kane 356). The ultimate goal, purpose of writing, presenting and viewing a play is to experience rasa realization.

> According to Bharata, rasa or 'sentiment' is the mental condition of delectation produced in the spectator of a play or in the hearer or the reader of poem, as the inevitable reaction of the bhavas or emotions manifested by the characters. He gives a detailed account of the eight different rasas, or 'sentiments', namely, sringara or 'the erotic', vira or 'the heroic', karuna or 'the pathetic', hasya or 'the comic', raudra or 'the furious', bhayanaka or 'the terrible', bibhatsa or 'the odious' and adbhuta or 'the marvellous.'

So these are akin to things like the feelings you would expect to get from different genres of play? For example, from "a comedy" (hasya?), "a love story" (sringara?), "an epic" (vira?), "a tragedy" (bhayanaka?).

From https://ijcspub.org/papers/IJCSP23A1029.pdf, these seem to be subdivided: "Rasas are divided into two categories: Primary Rasas and Secondary Rasas. Primary Rasas are ‘Srngara’ (“The Erotic”), ‘Karuna’ (“The Pathetic”), ‘Vira’ (“The Heroic”), ‘Bhibhatsa’ (“The Odious”). Secondary Rasas have their origin from that of Primary Rasas are ‘Hasya’ (“The Comic”), ‘Raudra’ (“The Furious”), ‘Adbhuta’ (“The Marvelous”), and ‘Bhayanaka’ (“The Terrible”). Bharata says, “The Comic (sentiment) arises from the Erotic, the Pathetic from Furious, the Marvellous from the Heroic, and the Terrible from the Odious” (107, VI, 39).

> It has been found that no one word or phrase is adequate to convey the total meaning of rasa. Rasa is actually the impression created on the mind of the sympathetic audience by the expression of bhavas or 'emotions' and is an experience the individual is subjected to on account of this expression. Bhava is the emotion that creates a sense of enjoyment or experience which in itself is an entity and that enjoyment or experience is rasa.

> Next, Bharata gives an account of bhavas ('emotions'). He explains that there are three types of bhavas: sthayi-bhavas ('static emotion'), sancari-bhavas or also called vyabhicari-bhavas ('transitory emotion') and the third is sattvika-bhavas ('responsive emotion').

It is not clear to me if these are feelings we hope to engender in the audience, or or the tone we present *in the performance*?

> The sthayi-bhavas are eight in number and they correspond to the eight sentiments and they are: rati ('love'), hasa ('mirth' [or 'laughter'], soka ('grief' [or 'sorrow']), krodha ('anger'), utsaha ('enthusiasm' [or 'courage']), bhaya ('fear'), jugupsa ('aversion'), and vismaya ('wonder').

But there does seem to be a one-one mapping from sthayi-bhava, the static emotions, to rasa:

|rasa|sthayi-bhava|
|---|---|
|sringara or 'the erotic'|rati ('love')|
|vira or 'the heroic'|utsaha ('enthusiasm', 'courage', 'energy')|
|karuna or 'the pathetic'|soka ('grief', 'sorrow')|
|hasya or 'the comic'|hasa ('mirth', 'laughter')|
|raudra or 'the furious'|krodha ('anger')||
|bhayanaka or 'the terrible'|bhaya ('fear', 'terror')|
|bibhatsa or 'the odious'|jugupsa ('aversion', 'disgust')|
|adbhuta or 'the marvellous'|vismaya ('wonder', 'astonishment')|

The next type of emotion are the transitory emotions:

> The vyabhicari-bhavas or the sancari-bhavas are thirty-three in number. They are: nirveda ('dejection'), glani ('depression'), sanka ('suspicion'), asuya ('jealousy'), mada ('intoxiation'), srama ('weariness'), alasya ('laziness'), dainya ('helplessness'), cinta ('anxiety'), moha ('passion'), smriti ('recollection'), dhrti ('boldness'), vrida ('shame'), capalata ('fickleness'), harsya ('joy'), avega ('agitation'), jadata ('stupor'), garva ('arrogance'), visada ('despair'), autsukya ('inquisitiveness'), nidra ('sleep'), apasmara ('epilepsy'), supta ('dream'), vibodha ('awakening'), amarsa ('intolerance'), avahittham ('concealment'), ugrata ('ferocity'), mati ('knowledge'), vyadhi ('sickness'), unmad ('insanity'), maranam ('death'), trasa ('fright') and vitarka ('doubt').

I get the sense these are things we want to evoke in the *audience* as part of the performance? Or are they triggers we need to activate as part of the performance that will then initiate a sympathetic feeling in the audience?

And then we have the responsive emotions (sattvika-bhavas). Again, are these responses demonstrated by the performer to reveal story, or the responses we want to somehow evoke sypathetically in the audience?

> The sattvika-bhavas are also eight. They are stambha ('stunned', or 'motionless‘, a sort of numbness that comes out of emotional shock), sveda ('sweating' or 'perspiration‘), romanca ('thrill', or 'horripilation‘, a thrilled state of mind when the hair on the body stands erect), svarabheda ('break in voice', a change in the tonal quality of voice due to overstress of emotion), vepathu ('trembling', or 'shivering‘), vaivarnya ('pallor', or a change in complexion of the face), asru ('tears') and pralaya ('swoon', or 'fainting.‘) (Natyasastra ch.6 par. 14-22).

I get the sense again these are feelings we want the *audience* to experience?

> Normally incidents that cause pain in real life create depression in human beings. But when the same incidents are described in a work of art or presented on the stage, an inexplicable pleasure is derived by human beings and that is rasa.

So an emotional scene *in the context of the story*, can generate a feeling in the audience that may be sympathetic to the emotions of the characters in the story.

> The actor interprets not only what is literal in the text, but also contributes his own by way of sub-text which is more implied than explicit and with his creative talent fills up the blanks that have been left over by the author. The imagery created on the stage with the expression of bhava produces rasa in the minds of the audience and makes the representation thoroughly enjoyable. Thus it is an experience shared equally by the author, the actor and the audience.

The actor has taken on the character of the person on the story, represents the character, and plays out the story to give the audience a fly-on-the-wall witnessing experience of a "lived realisation" of the story. The actor's familiarity with the character, and their backstory, and their presumed experience and knowledge of the inhabited world, brings emotional weight (through physical and facial expression, tone and cadence of voice) that presumably complement the actual words and the setting (the physical set and interaction of performers?).

Would it be useful to invoke the notion of something akin to Huizinga's notion of the *magic circle* in games / play as that space in which the story occurs (play *as* story; story *as* play?)? Presumably there is a related notion in critical theory / narratology etc? Some years ago, I wrote a short course on computer games (note: *I am NOT a computer gamer*), and included these possibly relevant posts: [Getting Philosophical About Games](https://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/getting-philosophical-about-games/) and [Do Game Players Tell, or Create, Stories?](https://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/do-game-players-tell-or-create-stories/) (see also linked articles in the latter post especially which might be useful). It may be worth re-reading *Home Ludens*, eg around the nature of game vs ritual ([example](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ALeXRMGU1CsC&pg=PA50&source=gbs_search_r&sig=BWa1LxfSmDq4rfn6PUR_lAKhl04&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)); maybe also Stewart Lee's references to a magic circle around religious satirist players in France? Spain? <- must find those refs.

If we think of *storytelling* rather than a theatrical play, we have: a story, a storyteller (who chooses the original framing, as well as the words, as well as how they are expressed), the setting, and the audience.

*ASIDE: How does theatre relate to game, and storytelling? In a game, the players are the actors and the audience living the story and witnessing it first hand. In theatre, the actors/set are living the story and the audience are witnessing it, then getting sucked in to the story somehow (whatever that means... Living it vicariously through the play (actors+set)? Is that the contract the audience has?) In storytelling, the storyteller is on the surface simply relaying the story to the listening audience; but ideally they are invoking the story in the space between the storyteller and the audience, and both sides are responsible for creating and playing out the story in the mind's eye as prompted or nudged by the storyteller. In theatre, the story is physically realised on the stage and sympathised by the audience and the players. In storytelling, the story is (mentally) realised in the mind of each individual in the room, and then individually sympathised with.*

> The root-cause or the excitant that creates the emotion is called vibhava or the 'determinant.‘ So, vibhava is the cause and bhava is the effect. The voluntary expression following the emotion caused by the determinant is called anubhava or the 'consequent.‘ Although the words vibhava and anubhava incorporate the word bhava it may be noted that they are not bhavas. Vibhava, anubhava and bhava are thus intimately connected with one another. The bhavas when expressed must be natural with their roots in the actual happenings in the world.

> Bharata in his Natyasastra has classified forty-nine such emotions into three main categories. They are sthayi or 'static‘, sancari or vyabhicari or 'transitory‘ and sattvika or 'responsive‘ emotions. The emotions that are retained in the minds of the audience till rasa is created are called sthayi bhavas. The passing emotions that contribute to the creation of rasa are classified as sancari-bhavas. The physical involuntary expressions that manifest themselves as a result of the intensity of emotion in the mental plane are called sattvika-bhavas. Bharata states that a configuration of these forty-nine emotions promotes the creation of rasa in the minds of the sympathetic audience.

> The Natyasastra explains that a 'sentiment‘ or rasa is produced by the union of determinants— vibhava, the consequent— anubhava and the transitory emotions— vyabhicari.

So the determinant (vibhava), the consequent (anubhava) and the transitory (vyabhicari) all stand in some relation to each other. What exactly?

> The determinants [vibhava] again fall into two classes— the *alambana* which are the fundamental determinants as the hero and the heroine, as without them there can be no creation of rasa in the audience. The second one is the contributory determinants the *uddipana* such as place, time and circumstances, the purpose of which is to foster the sentiment which has arisen.

So are the determinants the determinants *in the context of the play, or story*? That it, the *alabana* are the characters in-the-story, rather than the physically observable acted character? And the *uddipana* would then be the in-world social context and imagined physical setting, rather than the physical theatre set, for example? Or do the determinants relate purely to the physically observed behaviours without consideration of any "internal-world" context that is not literally portrayed (like the unspoken backstory of a character, for example, or the state of wealth and history we might associate with a family based on the physical depiction of a dining room created by a theatre set)?

It would appear the each rasa has a subset of triggering determinants:

> Examples of uddipana for sringara rasa [the 'erotic'] would be things such as soft cool breeze, the moon, smell of flower etc. that would foster the sentiment of love.

So this suggests a story feature, or story colour that needs to be invoked somehow?

*It would perhaps be useful to have mapping of example vibhavas to rasa. I wonder, is this a simple mapping ( alambana->rasa, uddipana->rasa) or a compound mapping ( (alambana,uddipana)->rasa)?*

>  While these constitute the vibhava [that is, the determinants], the anubhavas are the external manifestations of feeling by which actors communicate their mind and heart to the audience.

Okay... so the anubhava (the consequent) is the physical realisation of emotion by the character-as-played-by-the-actor? (i.e. in control of the actor). Which suggests the alabana [character determinant] is more the social context and situation of the character (i.e. the story element). The alabana relate to the story, the anubhava to the performance?

> Actors and actresses use eye-glances, smiles, movements of the limb etc. to indicate their feelings through actions and these constitute the anubhavas.

But to invoke the aesthetic response that is the rasa, we need more:

> The Natyasastra, however, recognizes that these factors are insufficient for the production of rasa. The emphasis is on the fact that the essential element for producing rasa is the sthayibhava—the dominant emotion, which persists throughout the drama amid the variations of the transitory feelings which come and go.

That is (*sthayibhava*), the eight sentiments or static bhavas. So presumably, you hope to leave a comedy with a sense of mirth (*hasa* sthayi-bhava) and an aesthetic experience of *hasya* rasa)? But to trigger the rasa, we need to establish sthayibhava.

For the performer, they have the story (which establishes the determinant (vibhava). their realisation in the form of a consequent (anubhava) performance, and then there is the transitory emotion (vyabhicari). Who or what expresses that? And what is it?
