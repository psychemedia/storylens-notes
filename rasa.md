Rasa theory recogsnised as the prime achievement of Bharata

> 'Nothing proceeds on the stage without reference to rasa' is Bharata's most important
pronouncement‖ says Raghavan in his research paper entitled ―Sanskrit Drama in Performance‖ (21). The
Sanskrit word rasa fundamentally means 'taste' or 'flavour' or 'savour' or 'relish'. In a metaphorical sense it refers to "the emotional experience of beauty in poetry and drama" (Kane 356). The ultimate goal, purpose of writing, presenting and viewing a play is to experience rasa realization.

> According to Bharata, rasa or 'sentiment' is the mental condition of delectation produced in the
spectator of a play or in the hearer or the reader of poem, as the inevitable reaction of the bhavas or emotions manifested by the characters. He gives a detailed account of the eight different rasas, or 'sentiments', namely, sringara or 'the erotic', vira or 'the heroic', karuna or 'the pathetic', hasya or 'the comic', raudra or 'the furious', bhayanaka or 'the terrible', bibhatsa or 'the odious' and adbhuta or 'the marvellous.'

From https://ijcspub.org/papers/IJCSP23A1029.pdf, these seem to be subdivided: "Rasas are divided into two categories: Primary Rasas and Secondary Rasas. Primary Rasas are ‘Srngara’ (“The Erotic”), ‘Karuna’ (“The Pathetic”), ‘Vira’ (“The Heroic”), ‘Bhibhatsa’ (“The Odious”). Secondary Rasas have their origin from that of Primary Rasas are ‘Hasya’ (“The Comic”), ‘Raudra’ (“The Furious”), ‘Adbhuta’ (“The Marvelous”), and ‘Bhayanaka’ (“The Terrible”). Bharata says, “The Comic (sentiment) arises from the Erotic, the Pathetic from Furious, the Marvellous from the Heroic, and the Terrible from the Odious” (107, VI, 39).

> It has been found that no one word or phrase is adequate to convey the total meaning of rasa. Rasa is
actually the impression created on the mind of the sympathetic audience by the expression of bhavas or
'emotions' and is an experience the individual is subjected to on account of this expression. Bhava is the emotion that creates a sense of enjoyment or experience which in itself is an entity and that enjoyment or experience is rasa.

> Next, Bharata gives an account of bhavas ('emotions'). He explains that there are three types of
bhavas: sthayi-bhavas ('static emotion'), sancari-bhavas or also called vyabhicari-bhavas ('transitory
emotion') and the third is sattvika-bhavas ('responsive emotion').

> The sthayi-bhavas are eight in number and they correspond to the eight sentiments and they are: rati ('love'), hasa ('mirth' [or 'laughter'], soka ('grief' [or 'sorrow']), krodha ('anger'), utsaha ('enthusiasm' [or 'courage']), bhaya ('fear'), jugupsa ( 'aversion'), and vismaya ('wonder').

> The vyabhicari-bhavas or the sancari-bhavas are thirty-three in number. They are: nirveda
('dejection'), glani ('depression'), sanka ('suspicion'), asuya ('jealousy'), mada ('intoxiation'), srama ('weariness'), alasya ('laziness'), dainya ('helplessness'), cinta ('anxiety'), moha ('passion'), smriti ('recollection'), dhrti ('boldness'), vrida ('shame'), capalata ('fickleness'), harsya ('joy'), avega ('agitation'), jadata ('stupor'), garva ('arrogance'), visada ('despair'), autsukya ('inquisitiveness'), nidra ('sleep'), apasmara ('epilepsy'), supta ('dream'), vibodha ('awakening'), amarsa ('intolerance'), avahittham ('concealment'), ugrata ('ferocity'), mati ('knowledge'), vyadhi ('sickness'), unmad ('insanity'), maranam ('death'), trasa ('fright') and vitarka ('doubt'). The sattvika-bhavas are also eight. They are stambha ('stunned'), sveda ('sweating'), romanca ('thrill'), svarabheda (―break in voice‖), vepathu ('trembling'), vaivarnya ('pallor'), asru ('tears') and pralaya ('swoon') (Natyasastra ch.6 par. 14-22).

> [The *sattvika-bhava*] are mentioned to be eight. They are: stambha or 'motionless‘, a sort
of numbness that comes out of emotional shock, sveda is 'perspiration‘, romanca or 'horripilation‘, a thrilled state of mind when the hair on the body stands erect, svarabhanga is a change in the tonal quality of voice due to overstress of emotion, vepathu or 'shivering‘, vaivarnya is a change in complexion of the face, asru or 'tears‘ and pralaya or 'fainting.‘ These eight form a separate category of emotions. 


But how do they relate?

> Normally incidents that cause pain in real life create depression in human beings. But when the same
incidents are described in a work of art or presented on the stage, an inexplicable pleasure is derived by human beings and that is rasa.

So an emotional scene *in the context of the story*, can generate a complementary feeling in the audience that may be sympathetic to the emotions of the characters in the story.

> The actor interprets not only what is literal in the text, but also contributes his own by way of sub-text which is more implied than explicit and with his creative talent fills up the blanks that have been
left over by the author. The imagery created on the stage with the expression of bhava produces rasa in the minds of the audience and makes the representation thoroughly enjoyable. Thus it is an experience shared equally by the author, the actor and the audience.

The actor has taken on the character of the person on the story, represents the character, and plays out the story to give the audience a fly-on-the-wall witnessing experience of a "lived realisation" of the story. The actor's familiarity with the character, and their backstory, and their presumed experience and knowledge of the inhabited world, brings emotional weight (through physical and facial expression, tone and cadence of voice) that presumably complement the actual words and the setting (the physical set and interaction of performers?).

Would it be useful to invoke the notion of something akin to Huizinga's notion of the *magic circle* in games / play as that space in which the story occurs (play *as* story; story *as* play?)? Presumably there is a related notion in critical theory / narratology etc? Some years ago, I wrote a short course on computer games (note: *I am NOT a computer gamer*), and included these possibly relevant posts: [Getting Philosophical About Games](https://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/11/getting-philosophical-about-games/) and [Do Game Players Tell, or Create, Stories?](https://digitalworlds.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/do-game-players-tell-or-create-stories/) (see also linked articles in the latter post especially which might be useful). It may be worth re-reading *Home Ludens*, eg around the nature of game vs ritual ([example](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ALeXRMGU1CsC&pg=PA50&source=gbs_search_r&sig=BWa1LxfSmDq4rfn6PUR_lAKhl04&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)); maybe also Stewart Lee's references to a magic circle around religious satirist players in France? Spain? <- must find those refs.

If we think of *storytelling* rather than a theatrical play, we have: a story, a storyteller (who chooses the original framing, as well as the words, as well as how they are expressed), the setting, and the audience.

*ASIDE: How does theatre relate to game, and storytelling? In a game, the players are the actors and the audience living the story and witnessing it first hand. In theatre, the actors/set are living the story and the audience are witnessing it, then getting sucked in to the story somehow (whatever that means... Living it vicariously through the play (actors+set)? Is that the contract the audience has?) In storytelling, the storyteller is on the surface simply relaying the story to the listening audience; but ideally they are invoking the story in the space between the storyteller and the audience, and both sides are responsible for creating and playing out the story in the mind's eye as prompted or nudged by the storyteller. In theatre, the story is physically realised on the stage and sympathised by the audience and the players. In storytelling, the story is (mentally) realised in the mind of each individual in the room, and then individually sympathised with.*

> The root-cause or the excitant that creates the emotion is called vibhava or the 'determinant.‘ So, vibhava is the cause and bhava is the effect. The voluntary expression following the emotion caused by the determinant is called anubhava or the 'consequent.‘ Although the words vibhava and anubhava incorporate the word bhava it may be noted that they are not bhavas. Vibhava, anubhava and bhava are thus intimately connected with one another. The bhavas when expressed must be natural with their roots in the actual happenings in the world.

> Bharata in his Natyasastra has classified forty-nine such emotions into three main categories. They are sthayi or 'static‘, sancari or vyabhicari or 'transitory‘ and sattvika or 'responsive‘ emotions. The emotions that are retained in the minds of the audience till rasa is created are called sthayi bhavas. The passing emotions that contribute to the creation of rasa are classified as sancari-bhavas. The physical involuntary expressions that manifest themselves as a result of the intensity of emotion in the mental plane are called sattvika-bhavas. Bharata states that a configuration of these forty-nine emotions promotes the creation of rasa in the minds of the sympathetic audience.
